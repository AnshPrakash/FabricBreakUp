# FabricBreakUp
You just had a breakup and your ex has dumped all your shirts in a big heap in the center
of your tiny hostel room. And man! These are way too many shirts. No wonder (s)he was fed up helping you choose
the best among them for every date :).
Anyways, whenever you find time, you start arranging the shirts from the big heap one by one. We will call the
arranged shirts (that are no longer in the heap) as good shirts. Since you have limited space in your hostel room, you
arrange the good shirts in a big pile (tower) on a side.
But, of course, every now and then you also want to party with friends to get over your ex. And at any time you go
out, you wish to wear your most favorite shirt from among the good shirts in the pile. Unfortunately, you are clumsy!
So, in trying to take out that chosen shirt, all shirts on top of that shirt get toppled and get mixed in the big heap
again. Your goal is to programmatically find how many shirts get toppled every time you party with friends.
